# angular-icons
A collection of icon libraries to use in your angular apps

## angularIcons.iconic (Module)

We partnered with the folks at [Iconic](http://useiconic.com) to include a sample of 24 icons from their responsive icon set. Angular Base Apps includes the Iconic JavaScript library, which we wrapped in an Angular module.</p>

## ba-iconic (Directive)

A wrapper for the Iconic data attributes, which allows you to specify the name of an icon insteead of the entire file path.

```html
<img ba-iconic icon="thumb" size="medium">
```

## Iconic (Service)

A wrapper for the `IconicJS` object the Iconic JavaScript places on the `window` object. Learn more about how the Iconic JavaScript works [here](https://useiconic.com/tools/iconic-js/).
